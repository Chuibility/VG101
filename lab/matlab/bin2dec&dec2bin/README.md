# bin2dec
Write your own program to convert a binary number to decimal number.

Start your program like this:

`function a_dec=Mybin2dec(a_bin, n)`

a_bin is a binary number and n is the number of digits.

# dec2bin

The reverse of the above.

Start your program like this:

`function a_bin=Mydec2bin(a_dec)`
