## About Honor Code

The code itself is based on open-source licence decided by the owner of code. However, if there is the same lab, it is the responsibility of JI students not to copy or modify these code because it is against the Honor Code.

According to the student handbook (2015 version),
> It is a violation of the Honor Code for students to submit, as their own, work that is not the result of their own
labor and thoughts. This applies, in particular, to ideas, expressions or work obtained from other students as well
as from books, the internet, and other sources. The failure to properly credit ideas, expressions or work from
others is considered plagiarism.
